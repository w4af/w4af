## w3af-python3 - Web Application Attack and Audit Framework for Python3

[w3af-python3](http://w3af.org/) is an [open source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)
web application security scanner which helps developers and penetration testers
identify and exploit vulnerabilities in their web applications.

The original w3af code only supports python up to version 2.7. This repository / fork is an
attempt to add python3 support.

The scanner is able to identify [200+ vulnerabilities](https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/blob/master/w3af/core/data/constants/vulns.py),
including [Cross-Site Scripting](https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/blob/master/w3af/plugins/audit/xss.py),
[SQL injection](https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/blob/master/w3af/plugins/audit/sqli.py) and
[OS commanding](https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/blob/master/w3af/plugins/audit/os_commanding.py).
